❓ Do DevOps Engineers need to know all AWS services?

👉 Answer (Easy & Practical):
“No, as a DevOps engineer you don’t need to know all AWS services because AWS has more than 200 services, and not every service is used in real-world projects.
Instead, you should have deep knowledge of the core services that are directly related to infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, and security. For example:

Compute: EC2, Auto Scaling, Lambda, ECS, EKS

Storage: S3, EBS, EFS

Networking: VPC, ELB, Route 53, Security Groups, NACLs

Databases (basics): RDS, DynamoDB

CI/CD & Automation: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, Terraform, Ansible

Monitoring & Security: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, IAM, KMS

The reason is, in DevOps you mostly deal with automation, scalability, deployment pipelines, and monitoring, so these services cover 80% of day-to-day requirements.
